<!-- start of the main lab content -->
<p>Throughout the Lab 2, we will learn how to do data wrangling and
explore two real estate datasets of King County maintained by <a href="https://www.andykrause.com/index.html">Andy Krause</a> at
Zillow:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>All single family and townhouse sales from 1999 through December
2023.</li>
<li>All single family and townhouse properties as of December 31,
2023.</li>
</ol>
<p>You can find the datasets and Readme file in <a href="https://github.com/andykrause/kingCoData">this repository</a>.</p>
<p>The due day for each lab can be found on the <a href="https://www.yuehaoyu.com/data-analytics-visualization/">course
wesbite</a>. The submission should include Rmd, html, and any other
files required to rerun the codes. <strong>For Lab 1–3, the use of any
generative AI tool (ChatGPT, Copilot, etc.) is prohibited</strong>. We
will run AI detection on each submission. More information about <a href="https://www.yuehaoyu.com/data-analytics-visualization/syllabus/#academic-integrity">Academic

<h2 id="lab-02-a-modifying-dataframes">Lab 02-A: Modifying
Dataframes</h2>
<p>Let’s first import the datasets and necessary packages. <strong>If
you are using a Windows computer</strong>, you need to install <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/">RTools</a> first.
After installing this data package with
<code>devtools::install_github(&#39;andykrause/kingCoData&#39;)</code>, you can
load the data with: <code>data(kingco_sales)</code> and
<code>data(kingco_homes)</code>. You can find the datasets and Readme
file in <a href="https://github.com/andykrause/kingCoData">this
repository</a>.</p>

<p>Have a look of this data through <code>View()</code> function or just
click the dataset name in <code>Environment</code> panel, we can know
there are 591,513 entries (records), 48 columns (features). Go ahead and
see what features do we have for each record using <code>?</code>. Note:
it only shows help if the dataset comes from a documented data package,
like we did here.</p>

<p>We saw a brunch of variables but let’s talk about the first two:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>sale_id</code>: The unique transaction identifying code.
Primary key for this data! Serves as the <strong>primary key</strong> of
the dataset — each row has a distinct <code>sale_id</code>.</li>
<li><code>pinx</code>: The unique property identifying code (Major +
Minor). Serves as a <strong>foreign key</strong> linking sales to
property records, which is <code>kingco_homes</code> in our case.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="pipe---a-unique-feature-of-r">Pipe - A Unique Feature of R</h3>
<p>One of the most distinctive features of R (especially through the
tidyverse) is the pipe operator <code>%&gt;%</code> or
<code>|&gt;</code>.</p>
<ul>
<li>chain commands together in a clear, left-to-right order.</li>
<li>Instead of nesting multiple functions, you can read code step by
step.</li>
<li>closer to natural language and easier to follow in data analysis
workflows.</li>
</ul>

<p>The default setting is <strong>without replacement</strong>, which
means each row can appear only once. But we can add additional augment
like <code>sample_n(5, replace = TRUE)</code>, so that the same row can
appear more than once.</p>
<p>If we run the code above several time, we will get different results!
Others will not get same results as you did, the codes is NOT
reproducible. So, we usually fix the random number generator using
<code>set.seed()</code>.</p>

Sammammish separately, we can use <code>mutate</code> to create a new

<p>Here we use <code>ifelse(test, yes, no)</code>, which is a vectorized
conditional function in R: if the test condition is TRUE, it returns the

binary variable to indicate with the view to both LAKES. We can use

<p>We can recode variables based on some conditions. For example, we
want, in <code>city</code> of <code>kingco_sales_twolakes</code>, BRK
region can be represented by <code>BRK</code> rather than separate city
names. This operation is based on <code>recode()</code>. Similarly,
<code>case_when()</code> can be used for more flexible recoding,
creating categories based on sale price ranges.</p>

<li>Select the columns: <code>pinx</code>, <code>city</code>,

<p>You may notice that we are using
<code>kingco_sales[, c(&quot;pinx&quot;, &quot;sale_date&quot;, &quot;land_val&quot;)]</code> instead
of <code>select()</code> to get the columns. This is the base R way of
extracting something from vectors, lists, or even dataframes , while
<code>select()</code> comes from <code>dplyr</code>. Both return the
same result, but <code>select()</code> is usually preferred in a
tidyverse workflow because it is more readable and flexible. You can
learn more about <code>[]</code> by looking at
<code>?Extract</code>.</p>
<p>We always want to know more than what <code>summary()</code> can
provide, <code>summarize()</code> (same as <code>summarise()</code>) is
a function in <code>dplyr</code> to summarise each group down to one
row. But how do we want to summarise a dataframe? Let’s test with our
<code>kingco_sales</code> data.</p>

<h3 id="groupby">Groupby</h3>
<p>One important and useful function is <code>group_by</code>. We know
that, before giving data to <code>summarise()</code>, we already select
all transactions in Seattle. However, many times, we care about the
differences across the groups, like Seattle vs. Redmond. Those city
information are categorical data in the column <code>city</code>. We can
easily use <code>group_by</code> to summarise by group. Now, we want to
explore all transactions after Jan 1, 2020 across cities.</p>

<p>We mentioned two variables are keys: <code>sale_id</code> and
<code>pinx</code>. <code>pinx</code>, property ID, exists in both
datasets, which serves as the <strong>primary key</strong> for
<code>kingco_homes</code> — each row has a distinct <code>pinx</code>.
Meanwhile, it is a <strong>foreign key</strong> in
<code>kingco_sales</code>: in <code>kingco_sales</code>, same property
can associate with more than one transactions.</p>

<p>Oops, we received the warning from R: Detected an unexpected
many-to-many relationship between <code>x</code> and <code>y</code>. We
expect there are multiple <code>pinx</code> in transaction data but
<code>pinx</code> should be unique in home data. That happens all the
time when you work as a data analyst: all kinds of messy and unexpected
data issues. Handling these challenges carefully is an essential part of
real-world data analysis.</p>

<p>We found <code>land_val</code> and <code>imp_val</code> are different
while others are same in general. To simplify the problem, we can assume
<code>land_val</code> and <code>imp_val</code> may be different while
others are same. Also, we should select rows with high total values.</p>

summarise and analysis.</p>
<p>For all property in Seattle, what’s the average total values per sqft

<p>The mean value of sale price in Bellevue is $1,888,176. Suppose we do
not know the population (all transactions), we only have samples. We can
use <code>sample_n()</code> to draw a random sample from Bellevue
transactions, compute the sample mean, then repeat 1,000 times.</p>
